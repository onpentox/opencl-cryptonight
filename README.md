Algorithms
==========
#### Currently supported
 * ✓ __scrypt__ (Litecoin, Dogecoin, Feathercoin, etc..)
 * ✓ __sha256d__ (Bitcoin, Freicoin, Peercoin/PPCoin, Terracoin, etc..)
 * ✓ __x11__ (Darkcoin [DRK], Hirocoin, Limecoin)
 * ✓ __cryptonight__ (Bytecoin [BCN], Monero)

#### Implemented, but untested
 * ? keccak (Maxcoin  HelixCoin, CryptoMeth, Galleon, 365coin, Slothcoin, BitcointalkCoin)

Dependencies
============
* libcurl			http://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/
* jansson			http://www.digip.org/jansson/ (jansson is included in-tree)
* openssl			https://www.openssl.org/

Download
========
* Binary releases: None yet
* Git tree:   https://github.com/wolf9466/cpuminer-multi
* Clone with `git clone https://github.com/wolf9466/cpuminer-multi`

Build
=====

#### Basic *nix build instructions:
 * ./autogen.sh	# only needed if building from git repo
 * Optimal GCC flags are built in - you only need to use -march=native if you want it
 * CFLAGS="*-march=native*" ./configure
   * # Use -march=native if building for a single machine
 * make

#### Architecture-specific notes:
 * CryptoNight works only on x86 and x86-64.
 * If you don't have AES-NI, it's slow. This implementation is deprecated and will not be improved.

Usage instructions
==================
Run "minerd --help" to see options.

### Connecting through a proxy

Use the --proxy option.

To use a SOCKS proxy, add a socks4:// or socks5:// prefix to the proxy host  
Protocols socks4a and socks5h, allowing remote name resolving, are also available since libcurl 7.18.0.

If no protocol is specified, the proxy is assumed to be a HTTP proxy.  
When the --proxy option is not used, the program honors the http_proxy and all_proxy environment variables.

Credits
=======
This faster CPUMiner-multi was forked from LucasJones', and has been developed by Wolf.
Special thanks to Intel for helping me with the usage of the AESKEYGENASSIST instruction, which I used to replace the calls to the slow, unoptimized oaes_lib.
Special thanks also to dga for his code with that loop - since it runs over 500,000 times per hash, it's extremely important.
